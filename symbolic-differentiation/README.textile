h1. Symbolic Differentiation Calculator

p. Given a supported function expression, see supported functions below, calculate the derivative function. The calculator is bundled with two "data-representations" which inform the runtime if the user expects expressions to be represented in the infix or prefix notation. See the *fix-test.lisp for example of how to run a calculation.

h3. Usage

p. Load a data representation (infix or prefix) then use the pretty-diff function to differentiate a function expression with respect to some variable and print the result. See infix-tests.lisp or prefix-tests.lisp for examples.

h3. The problem

p. Given an expression, determine the derivative function with respect to some variable of the expression. The calculator must support the transition rules represented by the following (E)BNF

| Symbol Class | | Transitions |
|&lt;number&gt;| =>|Any integer or real number|
|&lt;constant&gt;| =>|&lt;number&gt; &#124;&#124; A &#124; B &#124; C &#124; D &#124; E &#124; F &#124; G &#124; H &#124; M &#124; N|
|&lt;variable&gt;| =>|U &#124; V &#124; W &#124; X &#124; Y &#124; Z|
|&lt;negation&gt;| =>|- &lt;function&gt;|
|&lt;sum&gt;| =>| (+ &lt;function&gt; &lt;function&gt;)|
|&lt;difference&gt;| =>| (- &lt;function&gt; &lt;function&gt;)|
|&lt;product&gt;| =>| (* &lt;function&gt; &lt;function&gt;)|
|&lt;quotient&gt;| =>| (/ &lt;function&gt; &lt;function&gt;)|
|&lt;power&gt;| =>| (** &lt;variable&gt; &lt;constant&gt;)|
|&lt;function&gt;| =>|&lt;constant&gt; &#124; &lt;variable&gt; &#124; &lt;negation&gt; &#124; &lt;sum&gt; &#124; &lt;difference&gt; &#124; &lt;product&gt; &#124; &lt;quotient&gt; &#124; &lt;power&gt;|

p. The calculator must also support the differentiation of each &lt;function&gt;:

| Function | Derivative Rule |
| Constant | The derivative of a constant value is always 0. |
| Variable | The derivative of x is 1 iff the variable with respect to which the expression is being derived is also x, otherwise the derivative of x is 0. |
| Negation | The derivative of the negation of x is equal to the negation of the derivative of x |
| Addition | The derivative of the sum of x and y is equal to the sum of the derivative of x and the derivative of y. |
| Subtraction | The derivative of the difference of x and y is equal to the difference between the derivative of x and the derivative of y. |
| Multiplication | The derivative of the product of x and y is equal to the sum of the product of y and the derivative of x and the product of x and the derivative of y. |
| Division | The derivative of the quotient of x by y is equal to the quotient of the difference of the product of  y and the derivative of x and the product of x and the derivative of y and y raised to the second power. |
| Exponentiation | The derivative of x raised to the power of y is equal to the product of the product of the product of y and x raised to the y - 1 and the derivative of y. |
